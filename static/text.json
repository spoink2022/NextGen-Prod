            "Interest" : "Interest is earned on an hourly basis, at a rate of +${config.savingsInterest}%/h\nThis interest is compounding, meaning that you earn interest on your interest",
            "Timing" : "To prevent cheating, interest begins accumulating on the hour after you bought it\nFor example, if you put money in at 2:45, it is treated as if it was put in at 3:00, and therefore at 4:00 you would see an increase",
            "Finally..." : "Adding money to a savings account is equivalent to taking it all out and putting it back in + whatever else you added\nAll gains from savings are kept, but after depositing, you must wait until the next hour strikes before it begins earning interest (as per usual)"
